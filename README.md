---

## Streams
OpusVid will have multiple streams of licenses and Beta's.

There will be a FREE open source Community Version (CV) then there will be two different licenses versions which will be a paid version. There will be differences between all and will be explained in the following sections.

**At this point there is only the CV in the form of a very early public beta also known as, CV 1.0 Beta 2.**

### Community Version (CV)
The **Community Version (CV)** will be a **FREE** version of OpusVid in which is open sourced. This version will be available here on [GitHub](https://github.com/DevLexicon/OpusVid/).

With the CV, the documentation will be very limited and bare-bone similar to the documentation that is seen below in the [Installation](https://github.com/DevLexicon/OpusVid#installation) section. 

In addition, once the full script is launched the CV will only receive major updates and will receive them at a later time than the other versions. For instance, the paid version will get version 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1, etc. Whereas, the CV will only get version 1.0, 2.0.

The CV will not include much support from DevLexicon (the developers of OpusVid) and will be encouraged to use the "**[Issues](https://github.com/DevLexicon/OpusVid/issues)**" tab on the GitHub repository. For the beta versions before it hit’s the RL, EL, and BDV streams, the support for OpusVid will be a little more advanced to make sure a smooth transition and will show where improvements are needed.

If you submit multiple "**Pull requests**" that are beneficial to the script, DevLexicon may decide to award you a paid license for free.

### Regular License (RL)
The **Regular License (RL)** version will include all releases of OpusVid post launch. Included will be versions such as  1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1, etc. These releases will be available as soon as they are available.

With the RL version you will also get more detailed documentation to help with configuration, troubleshooting, and overall improvement tips. 

The RL and EL will also receive the ability to receive support from DevLexicon. The RL will receive medium level support (such as, basic configurations and basic troubleshooting | Slow Support) and the EL will receive high level support (advanced configuration and troubleshooting | Fast support). The support will be offered through “work orders” through the [DevLexicon Portal (Work Orders Coming Soon!)](https://devlexicon.ca).

Pricing and arability will be announced soon along with the launch of the first version of the OpusVid Script.

### Extended License (EL)
The **Extended License (EL)** version will include all releases of OpusVid post launch. Included will be versions such as  1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1, etc. These releases will be available as soon as they are available.

With the EL version you will also get more detailed documentation to help with configuration, troubleshooting, and overall improvement tips. 

The RL and EL will also receive the ability to receive support from DevLexicon. The RL will receive medium level support (such as, basic configurations and basic troubleshooting | Slow Support) and the EL will receive high level support (advanced configuration and troubleshooting | Fast support). The support will be offered through “work orders” through the [DevLexicon Portal (Work Orders Coming Soon!)](https://devlexicon.ca).

With the BDV as long as you spend over a certain amount, it will contain more detailed documentation to help with configuration, troubleshooting, and overall improvement tips. 

The BDV will also receive the ability to receive support from DevLexicon. The levels will range from low level support (such as base troubleshooting | Slowest Support). To the same as RL which will receive medium level support (such as, basic configurations and basic troubleshooting | Slow Support). To the same as EL which will receive high level support (advanced configuration and troubleshooting | Fast support).

- Upload the Favicon to `OpusVid Script Root Folder > storage > favicon`

## Upgrade
### Before Upgrading
Before you upgrade to CV1.0B2 or any other version, please make sure to back up your current files and database files. Most importantly please make sure to backup your storage folders and database files. Due to the major updates in CV1.0B2 you will need to reupload all files to your sever. There is an upgrade script included that will automatically upgrade your database.
### VIdeo Tutorial
You may watch a video tutorial of the upgrade process on [OpusVid: COMING SOON!](https://opusvid.devlexicon.ca/player?id=6137fac87421d)
### Downloading
Make sure you download the OpusVid Script (rather by downloading the “**[Release](https://github.com/DevLexicon/OpusVid/tree/release)** > **Code**” or [CV1.0B2](https://github.com/DevLexicon/OpusVid/releases/tag/cv1.0b2)). You can also fork the repository and use your severs git intergration to upload the files.
### Uploading
Once the files are done downloading please remove all the files from your server and reupload the newly downloaded files OR initiate the pull request on your git intergration on your server.
### .htaccess Update
- Go to your OpusVid Script Root Folder and open the “ `.htaccess`” file (You may need to go into your FTP/Server settings and “`Show Hidden Files`")
- Edit “`{WEBSITE URL}`” with your URL (**must include https://**) on `line 5` and `line 14`
### Upgrade (Part 2)
- Enter your SQL login information in the `models > classes > MySQL.class.php`
- Upload your backed up "`videos`", "`thumbnails`", "`avatar`", and "`favicon`" storage folders to your **Opus Root Domin Name** > **Storage**
- Go to your `Root.Domain/controllers/database/upgrade.database`
- Let the code run to upgrade your database
- If you see no errors display, you should be good. If you want to be sure, head over to your **PHPMyAdmin** and verify that the `collections`, `following`, `mail`, and `watch_later` tables have been deleted; the `categories` table has been added; and click on a few videos to make sure that everything is loading as expected, and if a video has no chapters, it should now display "The OpusCreator has opted to not display any chapters for this video".
- Effectivly you are done at this point.
### Additional Upgrades
With the update from CV1.0B1 to CV1.0B2 we have made big changes to the "Music Credit" formating and can't properly update the format through an automatic code. With this, you will have to rather ask your OpusCreator to update the "Music Credit" formating of their videos or you go in and update them. In addition, if you made any changes to any files, you will need to recode those files. If you had a custom font you will need to reimport that in the CSS settings, and the database CSS settings found at `"Dashboard" > “Administration +” > “CSS Settings”`.
### Upgrading Errors
If you run into any errors while running the upgrade script. Please check the database and script changes as listed in [Upgrade (Part 2)](#upgrade-part-2). If there is missformating of any type from that step, please go to your database and drop all the tables under your database name. Once dropped, please import your backed up sql file and rerun the upgrade script at `Root.Domain/controllers/database/upgrade.database`. If you are still having issues, please don't hesitate to contact us at [support@devlexicon.ca](mailto:support@devlexicon.ca).
