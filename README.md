## Demo
You may demo OpusVid at [opusvid.devlexicon.ca](https://opusvid.devlexicon.ca).

## Streams
OpusVid will have multiple streams of licenses and Beta's.

There will be a FREE open source Community Version (CV) then there will be two different licenses versions which will be a paid version. There will be differences between all and will be explained in the following sections.

**At this point there is only the CV in the form of a very early public beta also known as, CV 1.0 Beta 1.  This beta will be available to download December 3rd, 2020 at 10am (PST).**

### Community Version (CV)
The **Community Version (CV)** will be a **FREE** version of OpusVid in which is open sourced. This version will be available here on [GitHub](https://github.com/DevLexicon/OpusVid/).

With the CV, the documentation will be very limited and bare-bone similar to the documentation that is seen below in the [Installation](https://github.com/DevLexicon/OpusVid#installation) section. 

In addition, once the full script is launched the CV will only receive major updates and will receive them at a later time than the other versions. For instance, the paid version will get version 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1, etc. Whereas, the CV will only get version 1.0, 2.0.

The CV will not include much support from DevLexicon (the developers of OpusVid) and will be encouraged to use the "**[Issues](https://github.com/DevLexicon/OpusVid/issues)**" tab on the GitHub repository. For the beta versions before it hit’s the RL, EL, and BDV streams, the support for OpusVid will be a little more advanced to make sure a smooth transition and will show where improvements are needed.

If you submit multiple "**Pull requests**" that are beneficial to the script, DevLexicon may decide to award you a paid license for free.

### Regular License (RL)
The **Regular License (RL)** version will include all releases of OpusVid post launch. Included will be versions such as  1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1, etc. These releases will be available as soon as they are available.

With the RL version you will also get more detailed documentation to help with configuration, troubleshooting, and overall improvement tips. 

The RL and EL will also receive the ability to receive support from DevLexicon. The RL will receive medium level support (such as, basic configurations and basic troubleshooting | Slow Support) and the EL will receive high level support (advanced configuration and troubleshooting | Fast support). The support will be offered through “work orders” through the [DevLexicon Portal (Work Orders Coming Soon!)](https://devlexicon.ca).

Pricing and arability will be announced soon along with the launch of the first version of the OpusVid Script.
